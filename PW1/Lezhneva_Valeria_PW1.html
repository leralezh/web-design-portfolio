        <dt id="a"><b>a.</b>When HTML5 has become a standard? What were the main reasons for developing new standard?</dt>
        <dd><p>On 28 October 2014, HTML5 was released as a W3C Recommendation, bringing the specification process to completion.The main goals behind HTML5 were multimedia support, readability and consistency, backward compatibility, interoperability, complex web applications.</p></dd>
        <dt id="b"><b>b.</b>What is a difference between W3C HTML5 and WHATWG HTML Living Standard?</dt>
        <dd><p>The HTML5 specification, initially developed by the WHATWG, was the fifth major version of HTML. It became a retired W3C recommendation.The current standard, known as the HTML Living Standard, is maintained by the WHATWG and is continuously updated, while the W3C produces “snapshots” based on the WHATWG spec for stability.</p></dd>
        <dt id="c"><b>c.</b>What is the minimal HTML page code?</dt>
        <dd><p>The minimal HTML page code consists of the following essential elements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Document type declaration (DOCTYPE)</li>
                <li>HTML structure</li>
                <li>Head section</li>
                <li>Body content</li>
            </ul> 
        </dd>
        <dt id="d"><b>d.</b>Comment on semantic and presentational markup. Why presentational markup is considered deprecated now?</dt>
        <dd><p>Semantic HTML focuses on reinforcing the meaning of information in web pages and applications, rather than merely defining their presentation. It is processed by browsers and other user agents, while CSS handles its visual styling for human users. In contrast, presentational markup directly specifies how content should look, but it is now considered deprecated due to the push for separating content and presentation.</p></dd>
        <dt id="e"><b>e.</b>How you can check browser support for particular tag or attribute?</dt>
        <dd><p>To check browser support for particular tag or attribute we can validate HTML in our pages using tools like the W3C Validator. It ensures compliance with HTML5 standards and highlights any deprecated elements or attributes that should no longer be used</p></dd>
        <dt id="f"><b>f.</b>What are the audio and video formats, officially supported by HTML standard? What happens if you use other format?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>The HTML5 video element, introduced by the WHATWG, is the widely supported video playback technology in modern browsers. It replaced the proprietary Adobe Flash plugin. The officially supported video formats are MP4, WebM, and Ogg. If other formats are used, compatibility issues may arise, as browsers adhere to these specified formats</p>
            <p>For audio, the HTML standard supports MP3, WAV, and Ogg formats. Using these ensures consistent playback across browsers, while other formats may not be universally recognized</p>

    <h1>Feedback</h1>
    <p>I understood all the tasks in the practical work, but I had difficulty inserting pictures, videos and audio. I was able to carry out all these actions only by copying the address of the image, video and audio from other sites, but I did not understand how to insert the objects downloaded to the computer</p>
